To ensure the security and reliability of your website, consider the following:

2. **Regular Updates:**
    - Regularly update your website's dependencies and tools to patch any security vulnerabilities.

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    - Implement a CSP to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks.

    ```html
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self';">
    ```

4. **Input Validation:**
    - If your website has forms, ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
